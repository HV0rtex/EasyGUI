 *    - EVENT is when events are handled
 *    - PRE_DRAW is after the events are handled, but before the menu is drawn
 *    - POST_DRAW is after the components have been drawn on screen
 *    - CLEANUP is after the main window has been closed but before memory is realeased.

/**
 * @brief Defines a way to control the application flow
 * 
 * @details A routine denotes a procedure which is called if and only if specific
 * application events are fired. That way, it allows the user to control the flow
 * of the application.
 * 
 * For instance a routine may be called when a mouse is pressed on a button, but a second
 * routine may also fire if it is configured to fire whenever the mouse is pressed, regardless
 * of the mouse position.
