# Automata
The repository contains a series of bots (automatons) created for a specific set of tasks. This represents both a personal project and a way for me to automatize some of the things which take-up a lot of time. These bots are grouped into categories, depending on what purpose they serve. Under each category, all versions of the same bot can be found, alongside with a changelog.

# Design
The bots are implemented in C++, making use of the windows.h library to send inputs to the machine, simulating keyboard inputs and mouse presses to automate the tasks they are given. Ranges vary from chatbots to regular workers and traders.

# Collaborations
I don't do collabs on this specific project as it represents a way for me to self-improve
