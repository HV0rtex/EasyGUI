## Version V1.0.0 - First Release (18.09.2022)

This is the first release of the extension. As of right now, only basic facilities are supported:
- App creation
- Labels
- Buttons
- Routines

Note: **The application is not yet responsive**, as that feature has not been implemented. However
the Button's text is automatically centered withing the button borders.

The application provides a demo project that shows how much work is simplified and provides a ground for further projects (as one can simply use the skeleton provided in the demo), as well as standard **Doxygen** documentation.
